# SQL-and-Python-Program-for-SignUP
Sample Project for Sign up and login using Python tkinter
In this program, there will be two windows one for registering and another for login
First we need to register by giving details like name, mailid,mobile number, username and password.
After entering the details, click on register. In this i am using sqlite database to save the details entered via regster form. 
Using login window you can give Username and passowrd. 
If the username and password matches with data stored in the database, logged success msg will be displayed oterwise incorrect login and passwd msg will be displayed.
In this i have included label database which display the contents of register data.
